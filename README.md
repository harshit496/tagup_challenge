# tagup_challenge
This project is built using the Flask framework.

## Directions to run (Assuming python is already installed)
1. ```git clone``` & cd into tagup_challenge
2. In a terminal window type ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
3. Once everything is installed type ```export FLASK_APP=main.py```
4. then ```flask run``` and that should start running the application.
5. then using curl or Postman start making requests to the intended routes (eg: localhost:5000/api/list) and you should see the appropriate JSON output.
